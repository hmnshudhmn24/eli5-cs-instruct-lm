# ELI5 CS INSTRUCT LM

ELI5 CS INSTRUCT LM is an instruction-tuned language model designed to explain Computer Science concepts in simple “Explain Like I’m 5 (ELI5)” language, followed by clear, exam-ready explanations.

The model is built for students, teachers, interview preparation, and self-learners who struggle with overly complex technical explanations.

## 🎯 Objective

Computer Science concepts are often explained in a way that is:
- Too theoretical
- Too abstract
- Too hard for beginners

ELI5 CS INSTRUCT LM solves this by:
1. Explaining concepts in very simple terms
2. Reinforcing understanding with structured, exam-ready explanations

## 🚀 Key Features

- Instruction-tuned text-generation model
- Dual-style explanations (ELI5 + exam-ready)
- Focused on Computer Science education
- Hugging Face compatible
- Modular, extensible codebase
- Apache-2.0 licensed
